    <p>
        In the game, the player uses a slingshot to launch a variety of birds at structures made of materials like wood, glass, and stone. 
        These structures are inhabited by green pigs, who have stolen the birds' eggs. The goal is to destroy all the pigs on the screen 
        by strategically launching birds with different abilities to collapse the structures and eliminate the pigs.
