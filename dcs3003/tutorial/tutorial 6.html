<u>Premise</u>
<br>
In the game, the player uses a slingshot to launch a variety of birds at structures made of materials like wood, glass, and stone. These structures are inhabited by green pigs, who have stolen the birds' eggs. The goal is to destroy all the pigs on the screen by strategically launching birds with different abilities to collapse the structures and eliminate the pigs.

<u>Appearance</u>
<br><br>

The earliest known appearance of Chuck had him as a yellow-colored, triangular-shaped bird with two feathers on his head and two large eyes with black pupils. He was soon after redesigned to have smaller eyes with red eyebrows floating on them, four black, spiky feathers on his head, and three of said feathers on his back as his tail. He also has white feathers on his belly. In Angry Birds Toons, this design was slightly modified to have him with a somewhat different beak and more jagged head and tail feathers.

In The Angry Birds Movie, Chuck was given an anthropomorphic design. He is now shaped somewhat like a banana, and has three longer feathers on his crest instead of the shorter four he used to have. His tail feathers are much longer as well. In addition, Chuck has green pupils instead of the traditional black. Future releases would occasionally switch between Chuck's new body and his old one.

In Angry Birds Dream Blast, Chuck was redesigned once again to resemble a hatchling. While he keeps his triangular body from earlier games, he has wider eyes with the green pupils from the films. The feathers on his head and tail are as short as in the games, and end with a circular tip instead of a point one, similar to his earliest design.
