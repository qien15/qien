A <b><i>shepherd</i></b> boy in a village used to take his herd of sheep across the fields
near the forest. He felt this job was very dull and wanted to have some fun.
<br>
<br>

<p>
One day while <u>grazing</u> the sheep, he shouted,"Wolf!Wolf1!The wolf is carrying 
away a lamb!" Farmers working in the nearby fields came running for help but
didn't find any wolf.

<br>
<br>

<p>
The boy laughed and replied,"It was just fun. There is no wolf here."<b><i> The boy 
played a similiar trick repeatedly for many days.</b></i>

<br>
<br>

<p>
After some days, while the shepherd boy was in the field with the herd of sheep,
suddenly, awolf came out from the nearby forest and attacked one of the lambs.
The boy was frightened and cried loudly."Wolf! Wolf! <strike>The wolf is earrying a 
lamb away!'</strike>

<br>
<br>

<p>
<font size=5 font color=#dcacf2><b>The farmers <sup>thought</sup> the boy playing <sub>mischief</sub> again.</b> <font color=#24292e> So, no one paid
attention to him and didn't come to his help.
